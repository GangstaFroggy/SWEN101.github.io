        My name is Taveon and I'm a software engineer major at RIT. I went 
        to Thomas Jefferson Highschool in Jefferson Hills, PA (close to Pittsburgh). 
        My 3 essential places to eat on campus is Brick City Cafe for breakfast, 
        Crossroads for lunch, and Ritz for dinner. Also my favorite food is a medium rare 
        New York Strip.
